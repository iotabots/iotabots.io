These connected ecosystems are the foundation of the Metaverse.\n\nIn order to maintain law and order, the following 4 rules apply in the Metaverse:\n\n1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.\n\nAnd the most important law:\n\n0. A robot may not injure humanity nor earth, or, by inaction, allow humanity or earth to come to harm.\n\nThis means that the ultimate goal of a robot is to protect humanity and the environment of the earth.\n\nKeep that in mind and have fun!\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
